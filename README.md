Welcome to my Liri-Node app!

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. The user will type node into the command line, along with one of the following phrases: "concert-this","spotify-this-song", :movie-this", or "do-what-it-says", along with an entry. Liri will return the search results in the command line. The Spotify API, Bands in Town API and the OMDB API were used in this application. To see screenshots of how the app works, please refer to the screen shots in the "screenshots" folder in my repo.

Thank you!
